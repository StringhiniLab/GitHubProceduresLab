## Create Your Personal GitHub Account üßë‚Äçüíª

First, you need to create an account on GitHub by following these steps: [Creating an account on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

After creating your GitHub account, you'll notice that your profile is associated with a specific URL, structured as follows: 

- `https://github.com/<username>`

This page allows you to access your account settings and all repositories you create.

## Request Access to the GitHub Organization üè¢

Our lab has a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) that centralizes the repositories for everything produced in the lab.  
Notice that the organization's URL is different from your profile's:

- [https://github.com/StringhiniLab](https://github.com/StringhiniLab)

To gain access, you need to provide your GitHub username to the person managing the organization. Having access to the organization will enable you to create repositories within it.  

## Request Access to the Lab Team üîë

Not all lab repositories are public. To access repositories owned by other lab members, you must also be added to the Lab Team.  
Dr. Stringhini, as the owner of the organization, always has access to all repositories.  

- [Adding organization members to a team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team)
- [Managing team access to an organization repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)

## Installation Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

To work in the lab, you will need to have Git, R, and RStudio installed.  
Please note that the installation process may vary depending on whether you have a computer with Windows, Linux, Mac (Intel), or Mac (Apple Silicon) operating systems.  

- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
- **R**: [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
- **RStudio**: [Download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)  

Once you've completed these steps, you can move on to the next section. üéâ
