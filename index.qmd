## Goal {.unnumbered}

The purpose of this manual is to summarize the steps necessary for using GitHub as a Lab Member. 

## Why Use GitHub?

Git and GitHub were originally created for professional software development. However, their use has extended into the scientific field for various reasons:

- **Backup**  
Making it a habit to push to GitHub at least once a day allows you to keep an online copy of your data analysis.

- **Improved Documentation Practices**  
Having a complete README and knowing that your colleagues have access to your code encourages better organization of the project, making it clearer, more concise, and well-documented.

- **Version Control**  
It is easy to see how the project has evolved over time and recover changes from previous versions.

- **Reproducibility**  
When publishing scientific articles, maintaining reproducible results is considered a quality practice.  

Itâ€™s important to clarify that lab members are not expected to be expert users of Git and GitHub, but rather to handle basic commands necessary to achieve the use proposed.
