## Introduction {.unnumbered}

The use of programming languages for data analysis has made it even more necessary to apply computer science knowledge to ensure reliable and reproducible results. Currently, there are excellent and detailed materials and tutorials on various tools that can enhance computational reproducibility and transparency in research results (@scarpentry, @codingclub). However, there is a trade-off for scientists-in-training between adopting and practicing these techniques and dedicating time to studying their own disciplines, as it often requires significant effort.

Each lab should prioritize data and code management for its research, making informed decisions about the tools in which its team should receive training. This approach can establish a general data quality standard for the lab, adopted by each new member and further developed individually, as needed.

## Goal {.unnumbered}

The goal of this guide is not to be an exhaustive course in data analysis but to provide the **minimum necessary guidelines** for new members of Dr. Silvia Stringhini's lab to follow agreed-upon practices in data and code management.
