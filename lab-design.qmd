## Design for Technology Use in the Lab

Most of the databases used in our lab are private and do not contain enough data to be considered big data. These databases are used locally. 

- It is suggested to use a `raw/` folder and a `processed/` folder to separate unprocessed data from processed data.
- To ensure that the data is not made public, it is recommended to use a `.gitignore` file and avoid pushing the folder where the data is stored to the repository.
