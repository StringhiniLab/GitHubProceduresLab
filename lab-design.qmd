## Objectives {.unnumbered}

- Provide a quick onboarding guide and basic data management practices for new lab members, including data analysis backup and how to maintain the privacy of datasets by having clear steps to prevent pushing data.  
- Set guidelines on the use and management of code within the lab to facilitate sharing unpublished or complementary data analysis among current and former lab members.  
- Establish basic rules to publish public repositories associated with scientific articles, ensuring transparency in analyses and reproducibility of results.  
- Ensure consistency in managing data analyses over time and preserve and centralize the knowledge generated in the different projects.  



Most of the databases used in our lab are private and do not contain enough data to be considered big data. These databases are used locally. 

- It is suggested to use a `raw/` folder and a `processed/` folder to separate unprocessed data from processed data.
- To ensure that the data is not made public, it is recommended to use a `.gitignore` file and avoid pushing the folder where the data is stored to the repository.
